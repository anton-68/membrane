# Membrane Proof of Concept
## The Project Goals:
- To implement and maintain efficiently the necessary logic within the Home
Network will require some extended remote application management
capabilities which in turn assumes that some kind of application execution
environment is installed on the key elements of the Home Network.
- The main goal of this project from the implementation perspective is the
choice and proving the architecture and capabilities of such execution
environment.
